# Snippetbox

A snippet-sharing web application built in **Go**, following the *Let's Go* book by Alex Edwards.

This project was my introduction to building a full-featured web app in Go. It covers everything from routing and templates to user authentication and middleware. While simple in scope, it gave me a solid foundation in **idiomatic Go web development** and helped me learn the fundamentals needed for production-ready applications.

## üß† What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Project Organization**: Structuring a Go web app for clarity and maintainability.
- **HTTP in Go**: Using the standard `net/http` package and custom handlers.
- **Templates**: Building layouts, partials, and safe HTML rendering.
- **Forms**: Parsing and validating user input.
- **Sessions & Authentication**: Implementing secure login, logout, and session handling.
- **Middleware**: Writing reusable middleware for security, error handling, and logging.
- **PostgreSQL**: Writing SQL queries directly and connecting via `database/sql`.
- **Error Handling**: Defining and returning meaningful errors at each layer.
- **Testing Basics**: Adding tests for handlers and helper functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (net/http, html/template, database/sql)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendered templates
- **Sessions**: Secure cookie-based sessions
- **Tooling**: `go test`, `go vet`, and `golangci-lint`
